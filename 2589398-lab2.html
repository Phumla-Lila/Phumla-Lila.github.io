            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>A project that I am really proud to have been a part of is GuardianAngels,
                a flutter webapp that lets users connect with other people who are willing to 
                accompany them to places. It was made to reduce economic issues such as crime,rape and GBV
                to ensure citizens feel safe at all times.</p>
